  <h1>Track</h1>
</div>


**A lightweight CLI tool for managing development tasks with integrated Git worktree support.**

Track helps developers organize their work by managing tasks, TODOs, and notes in a context-aware way. It seamlessly integrates with issue trackers (Jira, GitHub, GitLab) and automatically manages Git worktrees for parallel development.

Perfect for developers who want to:
- 📋 Keep track of multiple tasks and their progress
- 🌳 Work on multiple features simultaneously without branch switching
- 🎫 Link work directly to tickets in your issue tracker
- 📝 Document decisions and findings as you work
- ⚡ Stay focused with a simple, intuitive CLI


## Features

### 🎯 Context-based Task Management
Manage TODOs, notes, and repositories without specifying IDs each time. Simply switch to a task and all operations apply to it automatically.

```bash
track new "Feature X"        # Create and switch to task
track todo add "Step 1"      # Automatically added to current task
track scrap add "Note..."    # Automatically linked to current task
```

### 🎫 Ticket Integration
Seamlessly integrate with Jira, GitHub Issues, and GitLab Issues. Ticket IDs are automatically used in branch names for easy correlation.

```bash
track new "Fix bug" --ticket PROJ-123
track sync  # Creates branch: task/PROJ-123
track switch t:PROJ-123  # Reference by ticket ID
```

### 🌳 Git Worktree Management
Automatically create and manage isolated working directories for each TODO, enabling parallel development without branch switching.

```bash
track todo add "Refactor auth" --worktree
track sync  # Creates: /repo/task/PROJ-123-todo-1
# Work in isolation, then merge automatically with:
track todo done 1
```

### ⚡ Simple & Fast
- **Intuitive CLI**: Natural command structure that's easy to remember
- **Single binary**: No dependencies, just download and run
- **Fast execution**: Built with Rust for maximum performance


## Installation

```bash
# Build
cargo build --release

# Install (optional)
cargo install --path .
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Create a new task with ticket integration
track new "Implement User Authentication" \
  --description "Add JWT-based authentication system with login/logout endpoints" \
  --ticket AUTH-456 \
  --ticket-url https://jira.example.com/browse/AUTH-456

# 2. Add TODOs (use --worktree to schedule worktree creation)
track todo add "Design database schema for users table"
track todo add "Implement JWT token generation and validation" --worktree
track todo add "Create login endpoint"

# 3. Add reference links
track link add https://jwt.io/introduction "JWT Documentation"
track link add https://github.com/example/auth-spec "Auth Specification"

# 4. Record work notes as you progress
track scrap add "Decided to use bcrypt for password hashing"
track scrap add "JWT expiry set to 24 hours for security"

# 5. Mark TODOs as complete
track todo done 1

### Workflow with Git Worktrees

```bash
# Register repository and sync (creates task branches and worktrees)
track repo add /path/to/repo
track sync

# This creates:
# - Branch: task/AUTH-456 (base task branch)
# - Worktree: /path/to/repo/task/AUTH-456-todo-2 (for TODO #2)

# Navigate to worktree and work on TODO
cd /path/to/repo/task/AUTH-456-todo-2
# ... make changes, commit ...

# Complete TODO (automatically merges and cleans up worktree)
track todo done 2
```

### Web UI

<img width="2520" height="2001" alt="de5e316bf86187756a01c867ddb199df" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49c5ce74-2eac-4448-87d7-1eadb4214743" />

| `track webui` | Start web-based user interface on port 3000 |
| `track webui --port 8080` | Start on custom port |
| `track webui --open` | Start and open browser automatically |

The Web UI provides a modern, browser-based interface for task management:

- **Real-time Updates**: Changes sync instantly across all connected browser tabs and CLI sessions via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **Todo Management**: Add and delete todos directly from the browser
- **Scrap Recording**: Add work notes through the web interface
- **Modern Design**: Dark theme with glassmorphism, gradients, and micro-animations

```bash
# Start the web UI
track webui --port 3000 --open

# Access at http://localhost:3000
```

## Task Aliases

Assign human-readable aliases to tasks for easier reference:

```bash
# Set an alias for the current task
track alias set daily-report

# Now you can reference the task by alias
track switch daily-report
track status daily-report
track archive daily-report

# Remove alias
track alias remove
```

**Task Reference Priority:**
1. Numeric ID (e.g., `3`)
2. Ticket reference (e.g., `t:PROJ-123`)
3. Task alias (e.g., `daily-report`)

**Alias Rules:**
- Alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores only
- 1-50 characters
- Must be unique
- Cannot use reserved command names (new, list, status, etc.)

## Task Templates

Create new tasks from existing task templates to reuse TODO lists for recurring workflows:

```bash
# Create a template task with common TODOs
track new "Daily Report Template"
track alias set daily-template
track todo add "Collect metrics"
track todo add "Analyze data"
track todo add "Write summary"
track todo add "Send to team"

# Create new task from template
track new "Daily Report 2026-01-04" --template daily-template

# All TODOs are copied with 'pending' status
# You can also use task ID or ticket reference
track new "Daily Report 2026-01-05" --template 3
track new "Daily Report 2026-01-06" --template t:TEMPLATE-001
```

**Use Cases:**
- Daily/weekly reports
- Release checklists
- Code review processes
- Onboarding workflows

## Ticket Reference

You can reference tasks by ticket ID instead of task ID:

```bash
# Switch task by ticket ID
track switch t:PROJ-123

# Archive by ticket ID
track archive t:PROJ-123
```

## Branch Naming Convention

For tasks with registered tickets, the ticket ID is automatically used in branch names:

```bash
# When ticket PROJ-123 is registered and sync is run:
track sync
# → Creates branch: task/PROJ-123 (base task branch)

# When TODO #1 has --worktree flag:
track todo add "Implement login" --worktree
track sync
# → Creates branch: task/PROJ-123-todo-1 (TODO work branch)
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Bug Fix Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create task for bug fix
track new "Fix authentication timeout" \
  --ticket BUG-456 \
  --ticket-url https://github.com/myorg/myrepo/issues/456

# 2. Add investigation notes
track scrap add "Issue occurs after 30 minutes of inactivity"
track scrap add "Likely related to JWT expiration handling"

# 3. Add TODO with worktree for isolated work
track todo add "Fix token refresh logic" --worktree

# 4. Setup worktree
track repo add .
track sync

# 5. Work in isolation
cd task/BUG-456-todo-1
# ... make changes, test, commit ...

# 6. Complete and merge
track todo done 1  # Automatically merges and cleans up

# 7. Archive when done
track archive t:BUG-456
```

### Example 2: Feature Development with Multiple TODOs

```bash
# 1. Create feature task
track new "Add user profile page" --ticket FEAT-789

# 2. Break down into TODOs
track todo add "Design profile UI mockup"
track todo add "Implement backend API" --worktree
track todo add "Create frontend components" --worktree
track todo add "Write tests"

# 3. Add reference materials
track link add https://figma.com/design/profile "UI Design"
track link add https://api-docs.example.com "API Spec"

# 4. Work through TODOs
track todo done 1  # Complete design
track sync         # Create worktrees for #2 and #3

# Work on backend
cd task/FEAT-789-todo-2
# ... implement API ...
track scrap add "Using PostgreSQL for user data storage"
track todo done 2

# Work on frontend
cd ../task/FEAT-789-todo-3
# ... build components ...
track todo done 3

# 5. Check progress
track status
```

### Example 3: Managing Multiple Tasks

```bash
# Create multiple tasks
track new "Refactor authentication module" --ticket TECH-101
track new "Update documentation" --ticket DOC-202
